# Elemental-Rental-DBMS
*Web Application Project ~ CISC 332 Database Management Systems*

This project involves developing a web-based interface for a rental database, named "Elemental Rental Database." The project leverages the skills and concepts taught in CISC 332 to create a functional and user-friendly application.

## Features

- **Property Overview**: Displays a comprehensive list of all property IDs, along with the names of owners and managers (if applicable).
- **Rental Group Preferences**: Enables existing rental groups to update their preferences directly through the interface.
- **Rental Group Listings**: Lists all rental groups, allowing users to select a group to view detailed information, including student names and group preferences.
- **Rent Summary Table**: Provides a summary table that shows the average monthly rent for houses, apartments, and rooms.

## Application Structure

- The application consists of multiple web pages, with the home page serving as the gateway, accessible via a rental page. This can be implemented using either HTML or PHP.
- Functionality is distributed across different pages, all of which are interconnected and accessible from the home page.
- The user interface is designed to be simple yet aesthetically pleasing, with the inclusion of at least one image to enhance visual appeal.

## Technical Details

- **Backend**: The backend is developed using PHP for dynamic content generation and can interface with nearly any DBMS.
- **Frontend**: The frontend is built using basic HTML and CSS to create a clean and functional user interface.

This project provides a hands-on experience in web development, emphasizing both the practical aspects of functionality and user interface design.
